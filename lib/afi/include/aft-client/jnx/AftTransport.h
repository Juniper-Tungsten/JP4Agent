///
/// @class   AftTransport
/// @brief   Largely virtual base class used for all Aft transport implementations
///
/// AftTransport is used as the primary connection between an Aft client and server. The transport is
/// responsible for handling all the underlying communications between the client and the server (in order to
/// simplify client design).
///
/// The transport has two primary interfaces. A simple interface to allow a sandbox to be created (if permitted),
/// opened, closed and released (again, if permitted). A transport can only have one open sandbox at a time. Once
/// a sandbox has been successfully opened, the client can use the transport to send it operations, which
/// modify the sandbox.
///
/// If a client has a need to drive two (or more) sandboxes at a time, it must create a transport for each sandbox
/// instance.
///
/// The underlying connection to the server can be as simple as a direct function call or a thread work queue.
/// It can also be as complicated as a serializer on top of an RPC mechanism. The goal is to isolate the
/// client from the transport mechanism so that different server orientations can be used without rewriting
/// the client code.
///
/// The transport handles a flow of AftOperation state. Primarily, this state consists of a flow of AftInsert
/// and AftRemove objects (which, in turn, contain lists of nodes and entries to modify). However, test
/// operations can also be inserted into the flow, along with other requests (such as telemetry triggers).
///
/// The underlying transport preserves the temporal ordering of operations. That is to say that a sequence
/// of operations A, B and C will arrive on the server as A, B and C. This is very important for consistency
/// as the node and entry dependencies succeed or fail on this preserved ordering.
